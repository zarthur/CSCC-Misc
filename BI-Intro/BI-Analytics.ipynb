    "## What is Business Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, business intelligence is the collection, analysis, and presentation of business information usually with the purpose of improving and informing decision making.  Business intelligence involves the collection of operational data from different parts of an organization, such as marketing, HR, and sales, in a single data repository which can be used to provide a higher-level analysis than any one department could do on their own. In addition to internal data, business intelligence teams can also use external data to analyze market trends or compare a company’s performance against similar companies in the same industry. BI can be used to analyze past performance, determine how well an organization is currently doing, or make future projections. Ultimately, the goal of BI is to transform data into meaningful information that can be used to guide users in their decision-making process.  "

    "## What can BI do? How can BI help? \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing data, BI can provide useful, actionable information to an organization. For example, when developing a new product, a company might be interested in purchasing trends for similar products. After releasing the product, the company can analyze posts on social media for feedback. The company could make use of demographic data to efficiently market to consumers who are most likely to buy the product.  By analyzing production and distribution data, the company could lower costs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "BI can also provide valuable information for internal decision making.  BI could be used to analyze resource utilization - helping to determine if additional resources are required or if current resources need to be upgraded.  BI can aid HR to determine how compensation and benefits offerings affect hiring and employee retention.  BI can be used to optimize an organization's website - analyzing the typical flow of traffic through various pages and optimizing the site for a better customer experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "BI can also augment existing data-gathering and reporting activities within an organization.  A finance team might be tasked with regularly reporting financial information - BI can not only aid in report generation but develop visualizations and dashboards that provide management with current financial information.  BI can be used to aid in real-time fraud detection by analyzing data and detecting defined trends.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there is a broad range of applications for BI.  "

    "## What are some real-world examples?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1993, gambling on Indian reservations and riverboats was legalized. Owners of existing casinos wanted to take advantage of this to expand into new markets.  To successfully expand, new casinos would need to attract and retain new customers.  At the time, companies owning casinos had marketing strategies geared toward each casino promoting itself. Further, these companies invested in in-casino malls and similar attractions to draw customers.  While this was successful in bringing customers into the casino, the cost to operate them significantly reduced revenue generated by the casino itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Harrah's Entertainment, Inc. chose a different strategy: to focus on their brand.  Rather than focus on each casino individually, Harrah's sought a company-wide approach to build brand loyalty.  Rather than invest in attractions that would be costly to maintain, Harrah's instead sought to better understand their customers.  By tracking customers across all their casinos, Harrah's could determine who their customers were, how often they gambled, how much they gambled, and what sort of offers would bring them to a casino.  This allowed Harrah's to target specific groups of customers with specific offers resulting in increased profitability. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, Harrah's invested a significant amount in its IT infrastructure and spent time redeveloping their marketing processes.  With a new system in place and backed by data, Harrah's could test different marketing strategies - expanding those that were successful and improving those that underperformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is Continental Airlines which, prior to its merger with United in 2012, earned several best-in-class awards between 2004 and 2010.  In the 1990s, however, Continental was not doing well.  Having gone through multiple bankruptcies and ten CEOs in a ten-year period, Continental launched a series of BI initiatives to improve their performance and position in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve revenue, Continental implemented real-time tracking of fares and sales allowing them to immediately gain insight into the response to different fares and adjust the numbers of seats sold at a given fare accordingly - this led to an increase in revenue.  Continental also began collecting more data on its customers and analyzing it more frequently - this allowed Continental to track high-value customers and reach out to those who might have experienced an unexpected disruption in travel.  This improved customer's view of the airline.  Dashboards were also developed to provide information about flight times and delays between airports - this allowed Continental to anticipate delays and react by allocating additional staff to expedite the flight services.

    "## Who works on a BI team?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any group of people, a BI team consists of people filling various roles each with different responsibilities. A BI team, like many groups within an organization, is led by a program manager who serves as a liaison between the team and the rest of the organization.  The program manager works with upper management to determine the goals and direction of the BI team and helps manage expectations.  The program manager also often serves as a BI advocate to the rest of the organization.  Within the team, the program manager oversees BI projects to ensure they meet defined requirements and standards.  For sufficiently large teams, project managers might assist with this responsibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some members of the BI will spend a lot of time work with other groups within the organization. A business analyst works with end users to coordinate the types of services or products the BI team will provide. The business analyst helps determine the needs and users and formulate requirements as well as recommending solutions.  Working with end users, the business analyst can identify new sources of data and gather feedback on work done by the BI team.  A data analyst will often work with users to understand the data that's available - possibly pulling data from various sources and integrating it to provide meaningful answers to users' questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are often several roles dedicated to managing data and provide reporting tools.  A data architect \n",
    "A data architect typically designs and, to some extent, maintains the data repository. A data architect will work with the maintainers of source data to profile the data, determining the size and content of data.  A data architect works closely with database administrators to ensure that the supporting infrastructure meets the team's needs.  Adding data to the data repository is the primary responsibility of the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) developer.  The ETL developer determines how source data will be collected and added to the BI data repository.  The ETL developer will often need to transform data to make it consistent (e.g., ensuring all dates are of a certain format) or alter it to have the same structure as similar, existing data.  A report developer or designer creates reports, visualizations, and dashboards used to provide information to users. For more complex analysis, a BI team might include a data scientist.  The data scientist employs advanced mathematical techniques to analyze data and create predictive models."

    "## Can Agile be used with BI?\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely.  Adopting Agile principles with BI development can BI more successful within an organization.  A common road-block to BI adoption within an organization is the time it takes to show value.  With traditional development practices, a BI solution might be obsolete when it's made available to an end user or the user who initially requested a dashboard might have left the organization. A common criticism of BI teams is that they are very data-centric - often focused more on the data than the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following an incremental and iterative approach to development with frequent user collaboration not only ensures that the BI team is able to respond to changing requirements but also provides value more quickly to users.  Routine validation also avoids wasting time and resources on a solution that is unwanted or not useful.  Being able to show value quickly, being able to respond to changing needs, and regularly responding to feedback ensure better user adoption of BI."

    "## What can go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "While BI can potentially help make sense of data and better inform the decision-making process, there are several important factors, external to the BI team, that can determine whether BI is successful or not in an organization.  A major factor is business need.  If there is no perceived need by potential end users, there will be no demand for BI solutions (and no work for the BI team).  Provided there is a business need, management support is critical.  BI makes use of data from and provides insightful data to different parts of an organization; management support is required to ensure that different departments coordinate with the BI team.  Further, management must ensure that a BI team has both resources and staff to complete its objectives. IT support is also critical to ensure there is sufficient and well-maintained infrastructure to support BI activities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can also play a role in the success or failure of BI in an organization.  Necessary data must be available to the BI team.  Generally, management can ensure that the BI team has access to the required data.  Beyond data availability, data quality is important.  Data of poor quality can require a lot of effort to clean-up, possibly requiring more time than is feasible for a project with a near-term deadline.  It is also possible that the existing data is insufficient and cannot be used to meet the needs of end users. With poor data quality, data collection must be improved before it can be used for analysis."
